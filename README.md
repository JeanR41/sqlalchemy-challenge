# SQLAlchemy Challenge

## Overview
In this project, we conduct a climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii, using data from a SQLite database. The objective is to explore precipitation and temperature data and create a Flask API that provides various climate data endpoints. This challenge is completed in two parts:

**Climate Data Exploration:**

 * Using SQLAlchemy and Python, data analysis is performed on precipitation and temperature records stored in a SQLite database.
 * Visualizations are created of the precipitation data for the last year for temperature observations at the most active station.

**Flask API Development:**

 * A Flask application is created to serve climate data through various endpoints.
 * API endpoints provide data on precipitation, stations, temperature observations, and dynamic temperature ranges for specified start and end dates.

 ## Files
 The project includes the following essential files:

 * app.py: The main Flask application that serves the API.
 * climate_starter.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that performs the climate analysis using SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
 * hawaii.sqlite: The SQLite database file containing the climate data.
 * Resources/: A folder containing the sqlite database file and additional resources.

 ## How to Run
 1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
 2. Navigate to the project directory.
 3. Open the climate_starter.ipynb Jupyter notebook to perform the initial analysis.
 4. Run the Flask API in your terminal.

## Conclusions
This project serves as an insightful exploration into the climate patterns of Honolulu, Hawaii, using both SQLAlchemy for database interaction and Flask for building an API to share the data. The analysis and visualization of climate data provide valuable information for both researchers and everyday users interested in understanding seasonal trends and variations in temperature and precipitation.
